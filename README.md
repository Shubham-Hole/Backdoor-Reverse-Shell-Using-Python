# Backdoor-Reverse-Shell-Using-Python
A Python-based reverse shell allowing remote command execution, file transfer, and directory navigation from a victim machine to an attackerâ€™s server. Designed for learning socket programming, client-server communication, and cybersecurity defense mechanisms in a safe lab environment.

#Project Overview
This project implements a Python-based reverse shell backdoor that allows an attacker to remotely control a victim machine. It consists of two parts:
  Server (Attacker): Listens for incoming connections from the victim, sends commands, receives outputs, and can transfer files.
  Client (Victim): Connects to the attacker server, executes received commands, sends back results, and supports file upload/download and directory navigation.
The project demonstrates socket programming, command execution, file transfer, and directory management. It provides practical insights into cybersecurity attack techniques and emphasizes the importance of defensive measures such as firewalls, antivirus, and network monitoring.

#Key Points:
1.Reverse shell connection from victim to attacker
2.Remote command execution and directory navigation
3.File upload/download functionality
4.Understanding both attack and defense mechanisms in cybersecurity

#Defensive Measures
1. Firewall & Network Rules: Block suspicious outbound connections.
2. Antivirus / EDR: Detect and remove malicious scripts.
3. Network Monitoring: Use IDS/IPS to spot reverse shell activity.
4. System Updates: Keep OS and software patched.
5. User Awareness: Avoid running unknown scripts or files.
